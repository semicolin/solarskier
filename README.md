# Solar Skier

A 7-day arcade game by Colin Stynes.

My original goal was to capture the rhythm and flow of skiing in a simple 2D game.
This was my first attempt at an HTML5 Canvas game.
It seems to work best in Chrome.
If it feels slow or laggy, try running it in a smaller window.

## Tips
- Control your speed by making turns.
- You will continuously accelerate while going straight.
- Stay near the bottom of the screen for slow scrolling.
- Go toward the top of the screen to speed things up.
